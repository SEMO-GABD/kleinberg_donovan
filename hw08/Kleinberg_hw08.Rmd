anderson <- dmy(anderson)
anning <- ymd(anning)
ball <- mdy(ball)
earle <- mdy(earle)
franklin <- dmy(franklin)
lederberg <- mdy(lederberg)
mcclintock <- dmy(mcclintock)
mlk_birth <- mdy(mlk_birth)
mlk_dream <- ymd(mlk_dream)

birthday

ball
earle
franklin
lederberg
mcclintock
mlk_birth
mlk_dream
```

Answer for 2.

```{r}
mlk_birth <- update(mlk_birth, year = 1929)

mlk_birth
```

Answer for 3.

```{r}
wday(birthday, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)

# I was apparently born on a Monday, figured as much. 
```

Answer for 4.

```{r}
present <- now()

year <- year(present)

present_birthday <- update(birthday, year = year)

present_birthday

wday(present_birthday, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

Answer for 5.

```{r}
future_birthday <- update(birthday, year = 2525)
wday(future_birthday, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)

justforfun <- future_birthday - birthday

justforfun

# That's a lot of days.

future_age <- year(future_birthday) - year(birthday)

future_age
```

Answer for 6.

```{r}
time_dif <- ball - anderson

time_dif
```

Answer for 7.

```{r}
mlk_time_dif <- mlk_dream - mlk_birth
mlk_dur <- as.duration(mlk_time_dif)

mlk_dur
```

Answer for 8.

```{r}
birth_dates_vector <- c(birthday, anderson, anning, ball, earle, franklin, lederberg, mcclintock, mlk_birth)
names(birth_dates_vector) <- c("Kleinberg", "Anderson", "Anning", "Ball", "Earle", "Franklin", "Lederberg", "McClintock", "King")

birth_dates_vector

## Leap Years 

leap_year <- leap_year(birth_dates_vector)
year(birth_dates_vector[leap_year])

## Time Between My Birth and The Others

days_passed <- time_length(birth_dates_vector - birthday, "day")
